# Solaris Disk Stats
# =========================
# Copyright (C) 2019
# =========================
# Description: 
# This program will create two nodes: Device, which
# provides metrics by device name; Disk, which provides metrics by mount point.
# N.B.: Inode metrics are currently unavailable for the version of DF
# used in Solaris.
# =========================
# Usage: perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/solaris/sunDiskStats.pl [/filesystem1 /filesystem2 ...]
#
# Adding a filesystem to the commandline will cause the program to only report
# metrics for the specified device and/or disk.
