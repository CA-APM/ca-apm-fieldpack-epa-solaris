## APMIA instructions (without ACC bundle)
* Create a subdirectory called _SolarisMonitor_ and copy in the contents of _post-10.5_ to &lt;apmia_home&gt;/extensions.  
* Edit &lt;apmia_home&gt;/extensions/Extensions.profile  
* Add your extension directory name to the list in property  

    introscope.agent.extensions.bundles.boot.load=SolarisMonitor
    

## APMIA instructions (with ACC bundle)
* Export the bundle using the Bundle URL in ACC.
* Copy the GZIP to &lt;apmia_home&gt;/extensions/deploy.  

_N.B._: No changes are necessary to Extensions.profile since the edits were done in ACC.

Restart the agent to complete the installation.

# Usage Instructions  

## How to create an ACC bundle for Infrastructure Agent (APMIA)
* The files located in the 'post-10.5' folder are already preconfigured for creating a bundle. Place a copy of your CLI file in the _data_ folder.  
Delete 'readme.txt' in this folder.   
* Obtain a copy of 'PrintMetric.pm' from your EPAgent archive and place in the 'lib/perl/Wily'.  
Delete 'readme.txt' in this folder.  
* Update 'description.md' and 'bundle.json' in the _metadata_ folder.  
* Create a ZIP file of the 'post-10.5' contents, ensuring you don't include the parent folder.  
* Upload the ZIP file to your ACC instance.

## How to debug and troubleshoot the field pack
Update the root logger in &lt;epa_home&gt;/IntroscopeEPAgent.properties from INFO to DEBUG, then save. No need to restart the JVM.
You can also manually execute the plugins from a console and use perl's built-in debugger.
